pyRetro
=======

pyRetro is a MAME frontend written in pygame. It is easy to use and nearly automatic configuration.

It is focused for use in arcade machine cabinets.

Prerequisites
=============

- Linux-like machine with commands like "grep, sed"

- Python interpreter (http://www.python.org/)

- pyGame (http://www.pygame.org/)

- MAME (http://mamedev.org/ or, if you have Ubuntu http://sdlmame.wallyweek.org/)

Note:

pyRetro works well if MAME is configured correctly because it reads some
configurations options straight from MAME config.

Also, make sure you have snaps of your favorite games and configured the right
path for them in MAME config, so pyRetro can show them in the snap frame.

Run
===

First make sure you have your MAME emulator installed and working (try to run it
and see if all is working correctly)

Then run ./runme.sh

If something went wrong, check if the autogenerated config in
$HOME/.pyRetro/config.cfg has correct values for you and eventually correct them.

The runme.sh script writes pyRetro output in pyretro.log

Usage
=====

Key bindings are:

LEFT,RIGHT,UP,DOWN: move across roms list

LALT or C: add/remove to/from favorities

SPACE: change current listing mode

LCTRL: commit yes/no dialog choice
